% 1. I would like to be considered for the position of [title copied from job ad] in [exact department name from job ad] at the [exact institution name from job ad]. I am an advanced doctoral candidate in [your department].
% I would recommend, “I am writing in application to the position…”

I write to apply for the Department of Statistics faculty position at The University of Auckland. I received my PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2015, and have worked in the private sector as a statistical analyst for the past two years. My training in statistics, data visualization, bioinformatics, and psychology has prepared me to work with researchers in other disciplines to creatively solve problems with data.

% 2. My doctoral project is a study of [cocktail party description]. Much of the research on this topic suggests that [characterize the literature as woefully inadequate]. But I [demonstrate, reveal, discover] that contrary to received wisdom, [your punch line].

% 3. To complete this research I have spent [X years] doing [fieldwork/lab work/archival work/statistical analysis]. I have traveled to [these cities or libraries], interviewed [X number of experts], created [original datasets/original compositions/original artwork].
% “This sentence should be followed by a paragraph with the story of your research process. Overwhelm the committee with the volume of artifacts you’ve studied, people you’ve talked to, time you have dedicated or places you’ve been.”
%  Deliver this information crisply, factually, in no more than 2 sentences.

% 4. I have completed [X] of [Y] chapters of my dissertation, and I have included two substantive chapters as part of my writing sample.
% This is ok, although telling them what chapters you have finished in the dissertation is less important than telling them a concrete defense date in the first sentence, in my view.  Talk is cheap, but a defense date doesn’t lie.

% 5. I have well-developed drafts of several other chapters, and expect to defend in [month, year]. OR Having defended in [month, year], I plan to [turn it into a book-length manuscript for a major scholarly press/select key chapters for publication in disciplinary journals].
% “If any of your committee members are unwilling to commit to even a season of the year for your defense date, or you don’t have two substantive chapters to submit to the hiring committee, it’s too early for you to be on the academic job market.”
My doctoral research focused on human perception of statistical graphics, with the ultimate goal of designing graphics to effectively communicate statistical results. Research on graphical perception is conducted in many different fields, including psychology, statistics, human-computer interaction, and communication. In each of these fields, though, the research focuses either on extremely low-level effects, or very specific problems that are not applicable to most statistical graphics. Integrating an understanding of human perception and methodology from cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction in an interdisciplinary approach to this problem, I am exploring several facets of human perception that meaningfully impact the way we interact with statistical graphics. My dissertation covered perceptual distortions that impact variance estimation along nonlinear trend lines (the ``sine illusion"), the influence of visual ability on graphical inference, and which features of a graph are most visually compelling. Two experiments examining the sine illusion were presented at JSM in 2013 and 2014, and two articles have been accepted for publication in JCGS; another paper was presented at InfoVis in 2015.

Since graduation, I have continued to work on research into the perception of statistical graphics, though on a part-time basis. I designed and conducted an experiment to examine the effect of color schemes on feature perception in statistical graphics, and more recently I worked on a paper exploring the reproducibility of graphs from the 1874 Statistical Atlas (based on the 1870 US Census). I am also hoping to conduct a study in the near future on the effect of contextual information on the utility and readability of statistical charts.

During my academic career, I regularly collaborated with researchers in bioinformatics, genetics, and engineering, assisting with statistical analyses as well as data visualization. My masters' research, a collaboration between bioinformatics and materials engineering, presented a nonparametric algorithm designed to mimic human perception of peaks in spectroscopy data with higher resolution than manual peak identification methods. I also worked with soybean geneticists at the USDA to explore, analyze, and visualize populations of soybean sequence data; the massive amount of data are particularly challenging to visualize, as even heavily summarized data can overload the human visual system easily.

My current position as an engineering statistical analyst has provided me with experience in how data science is conducted in industry, and I have taken an active leadership role in developing the role of data science at Nebraska Public Power District, working with IT personnel and continuous improvement teams to create an infrastructure which supports data science, to train analysts in the use of R and statistical techniques, and to produce results on small projects which lead to management buy-in for more ambitious modeling initiatives.

While I have enjoyed my time in industry, I miss the freedom to pursue research topics in data visualization and the diversity of academic collaborations - working on genetic data one day and census data the next. I hope to push the current understanding of graphical perception further by conducting experiments to identify situations where popular recommendations for graphical displays may not make the best use of the capabilities of the human perceptual system. I also plan to investigate the perception of interactive graphics, creating guidelines for interactive graphics optimized for the human visual system. Visualizations which respond to user attention dynamically and incorporate motion through animation or other transitions have the potential to more intuitively communicate experimental results. The additional complexity of such graphics may reduce the amount of information that can be encoded, due to the increased demands on working memory and attention. As web-based interactive visualizations become more common, it is important that statisticians design graphics that are not only visually attractive, but also clearly communicate the overarching message in perceptually appropriate ways.

% 6. Although my primary area of research is [disciplinary keyword here], I have additional expertise in [another disciplinary keyword here] and am eager to teach in both areas. I have [taught/served as a teaching assistant] in courses about [A, B and C]. In the next few years, I hope to develop courses in [X and Y].
% Of course you must describe teaching competencies, but don’t do it with vague claims and emotion-talk.  Eager?  Hope?  How does that help us?  Again, 250 other people will resting their cases on exactly the same feelings. Give us facts and specifics instead.

In addition to my research, I have experience teaching both computational and introductory statistics classes. For several years, I taught workshops on R programming as a resource for the Iowa State community (students, researchers, and local businesses), introducing the language and presenting advanced topics including data visualization, formatting and arranging data for analysis, linear models. At Nebraska Public Power District, I taught similar workshops to analysts who were familiar with Microsoft Excel or SQL, but who were not statisticians. Extending this series, I designed workshops using new software packages, such as \texttt{knitr} for reproducible research and Rstudio's \texttt{Shiny} package for creating interactive web applets. I also have experience teaching undergraduate and graduate introductory statistics lab courses for engineering, bioinformatics, social science, and business students. In the private sector, I used these teaching skills to explain statistical concepts to engineers and managers in simple terms. In both settings, I utilize frequent examples which allowed students or colleagues to independently apply the statistical or programming concepts in a guided setting, reinforcing students' understanding of the material and providing opportunities for self-assessment and feedback.

% 7. For the most part, my approach to research is through [social science or humanistic method keyword here], and I would be interested in developing a methods class on this approach to research.
Throughout my career, I have focused on collaboration with researchers in other disciplines and participated in interdisciplinary programs where those programs were available. Throughout my many interactions with non-statisticians in a technical setting, I have become aware of the difficulty of communicating statistical information to people who are uninterested or even afraid of statistics. I am interested in developing or teaching a class which focuses on strategies for communication of technical results in a non-technical manner, including the use of graphics and charts to effectively convey information.

% 8. Although I have been focused on my graduate research for several years, I have been actively involved in conversations with [scholars in the department you are applying to, or scholars at other universities/professional associations/conferences/other disciplines].
% “This can be the one paragraph about service, highlighting conferences you’ve attended, workshops you’ve organized, and other ways you’ve supported your discipline.”
% The key here is conferences. Those are peer-reviewed and your attendance at them will set your record apart.  Never hang your hat on service.

% covered in the research and teaching sections

% 9. In the next few years, I hope to be able to investigate [reasonably related problems or questions].
% Everybody needs a second project.  However, please don’t articulate it in vague aspirational feeling language like “hope.”  Are you really that unsure?  That doesn’t inspire confidence.  And while we’re on the subject, don’t try, attempt, endeavor, or seek, either.  Read my post: Do. Or Do Not. There Is No Try.

% covered earlier

% 10. I am interested in this post for a variety of reasons: [something about the character of the department/university/community/city].
%% Need to tailor this to University of Auckland%%
If there are any additional materials I can provide, please feel free to contact me directly or look through my research and current projects on github. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

% 11. Because of my graduate training, my doctoral research, and my teaching [experience/interests], I am uniquely qualified for this job.
