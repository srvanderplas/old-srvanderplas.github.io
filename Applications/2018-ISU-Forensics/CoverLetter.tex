I am writing to apply for the tenure-track faculty position in Forensics (posting \# 800196). As you know, I returned to Iowa State in 2018 to work with CSAFE, with the goal of leveraging my computational skills and experience working with large data sets to make the justice system more equitable, efficient, and unbiased. I am actively working on several projects in forensics, including shoes, bullets, and human factors. I love the research that I am doing, but I miss teaching and interacting with students and would like a position that includes these responsibilities in addition to research. 

Shortly after I received my PhD, I took a job as a statistical analyst for Nebraska Public Power District. I worked on many different predictive and inferential projects, assessing the impact of weather on power plant operations, evaluating machinery reliability, and identifying factors related to employee retention. I also designed an internal training program for data science/business intelligence, which led to an unexpected opportunity to teach statistics and data science skills to a diverse set of professionals, from engineers to administrative assistants. This program gave me insight into the challenges companies face as they incorporate data-driven decision making into their core operations, as well as the skill sets required for data scientists. I also discovered that no matter how correct the analysis, the results only mattered if I could quickly and effectively communicate the problem, analysis, and results to stakeholders and managers. I plan to teach data science as a combination of statistical techniques, computing, and communication skills.

Since working with CSAFE, I have found that forensic practitioners can be similarly wary of statistics - they are interested in some of our recent advances, but resist bringing these advances into the lab. Some of this caution is justified: in almost every area of forensics, there are tasks which humans do automatically, but which are hard for computers. Using algorithms designed to mimic the human approach to the problem, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, we can combine the strengths of man and machine. We can then increase the acceptance and impact of new methods by emphasizing the similarities between the examiner's approach and the algorithm's approach, catalyzing changes in the forensic community. I am currently working with a graduate student to apply CNNs to features of shoe treads, which will make automatic identification of shoe models a much easier task; we have plans to use the same technique to identify bullet scans which are low quality and not fit for analysis.

My PhD research in graphics and visualization has obviously shaped the way I approach statistics, but along the way I also developed skills and expertise in simulation, software development, image analysis, and working with large data sets. I use all of these skills on a daily basis at CSAFE, but most of them are also essential for data science. One of the biggest differences between data science and statistics seems to be the expectation that data scientists have not only expertise in statistical methods and analysis, but also that they have some ability to build data analysis pipelines to transform messy data into meaningful results. The bullet project at CSAFE is a good example of the need for both statistical skills and computational skills in data science: the final product is an open source software package that encapsulates the data processing pipeline, but there is significant statistical work to validate the machine learning algorithms underpinning the matching process. I am currently working on several publications related to the project: a validation of the matching algorithm on several case studies, a method for generating known matching and known non-matching sequences using the threshold bootstrap, and a discussion of the importance of unit testing and continuous integration in software developed for use in forensics. These projects span the spectrum of `data science', from applications of theoretical methods to software engineering. 
% Over the summer, I began working with the bullet matching project at CSAFE. I began with some software engineering work in collaboration with Dr. Hofmann, but then started a separate project applying the threshold bootstrap land cross sections to generate simulated known non-matching and known matching sequences. This will allow us to examine the distribution of match scores under each condition without collecting obscene amounts of data, and will additionally allow calculation of the error rate of the bullet matching algorithm.

I believe my experience as a data scientist and as research faculty in statistical forensics make me a good candidate for a forensics-focused tenure track position in the statistics department. In particular, I have experience teaching and mentoring students learning data science, developing statistical software, and utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques, in forensics and in other domains. I enjoy working at CSAFE and being a faculty member in the statistics department, and I am ready for the additional responsibility of teaching courses and working more closely with students. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information to assist you with your decision, and thank you for your consideration.  


% I have collaborated on research in a number of different fields, including psychology, engineering, and genetics, but the one common thread through all of these projects has been my focus on communicating the results of statistical analyses using visual and graphical tools. I am a senior researcher on an NIJ grant for 2019 to explore the best ways to use ROC curves to communicate the strength of forensic evidence to examiners, lawyers, and jurors. I am also laying the groundwork for a human factors project that will be part of the CSAFE renewal proposal, examining how jurors evaluate statistical evidence. My PhD research focused on the perception of statistical graphics,
