I am writing to apply for the tenure-track faculty position in statistics with a focus on social science (posting \# 800190). As you know, I returned to Iowa State in 2018 to work with CSAFE, with the goal of leveraging my computational skills and experience working with large data sets to make the justice system more equitable, efficient, and unbiased. I am actively working on several projects at the intersection of machine learning, psychology, computing, statistics, and the legal system. I love the research that I am doing, but I miss teaching and interacting with students and would like a position that includes these responsibilities in addition to research. 

Shortly after I received my Ph.D., I took a job as a statistical analyst for Nebraska Public Power District. I worked on many different predictive and inferential projects, including the development of a model to predict employee turnover as well as assessing equipment reliability and the impact of the weather on operations. I also designed an internal training program for business intelligence, which led to an unexpected opportunity to teach statistics and data science skills to a diverse group including engineers to administrative assistants. This program gave me insight into the challenges companies face as they incorporate data-driven decision making into their core operations, as well as the skill sets required for data scientists. I found that no matter how correct the analysis, the results only mattered if I could quickly and effectively communicate the problem, analysis, and results to stakeholders and managers. As a result, I plan to incorporate both communication skills and practical computing skills when I teach data science and statistics, so that students have the skills to be effective in industry or academia. 

Since working with CSAFE, I have found that forensic practitioners can be similarly wary of statistics - they are interested in some of our recent advances, but resist bringing these advances into the lab. Some of this caution is justified: in almost every area of forensics, there are tasks which humans do automatically, but which are hard for computers. Using algorithms designed to mimic the human approach to the problem, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, we can combine the strengths of man and machine. We can then increase the acceptance and impact of new methods by emphasizing the similarities between the examiner's approach and the algorithm's approach, catalyzing changes in the forensic community. These are classic machine learning algorithms, but incorporate knowledge of human memory, perception, and cognitive processes. I am currently supervising a student who is using CNNs to identify class characteristics in shoe images; we are working on a paper describing the results and expect to start working on a similar project with bullet images early next year. Another study I am hoping to do in the next year or so is to use eye-tracking equipment to compare the features forensic examiners use to make their decisions with the features used by machine learning algorithms. Combining knowledge of human perception and statistical algorithms improves the algorithms as well as our ability to explain those algorithms to practitioners. 

My Ph.D. research in graphics and visualization has obviously influenced my approach to statistics, in part because my undergraduate work was in cognitive psychology as well as applied mathematics. I leveraged that training during my doctoral work, publishing three papers exploring the relationship between the human visual system and statistical graphics in JCGS and TVCG. Since graduation, I have continued visualization research, following up on my dissertation work as well as adding new projects. While in industry, I worked on projects and publications in my spare time; since returning to Iowa State, I have been able to maintain this research in addition to my forensics-related projects. 

One of the biggest differences between data science and statistics seems to be the expectation that data scientists not only have expertise in statistical methods and analysis, but also that they have some ability to build software pipelines to transform messy data into meaningful results. A single project I am working on at CSAFE spans the continuum between statistics and computing: the final product is an open source software package that encapsulates the data processing pipeline, but there is significant statistical work to validate the machine learning algorithms underpinning the process and to explore expected distribution of the results under different conditions. I am currently working on three publications related to the project: demonstrating the algorithm on several case studies, a method for generating simulated input data using the threshold bootstrap, and another explaining importance of unit testing and continuous integration in software developed for use in forensics. I may have started with psychology, found statistics through bioinformatics, and developed an interest in computing along the way, but I can leverage each of these to create a productive, interdisciplinary research portfolio.

% Teaching paragraph here
The main goal of data visualization is to understand and communicate statistical information in an approachable and digestible manner. This focus provides an advantage when teaching, because I communicate with visual illustrations of statistical and computational concepts in addition to verbal explanations. While a graduate student in this department, I had the privilege to teach the lab portions of several graduate and undergraduate courses, as well as R programming seminars for the Iowa State community. After graduation, I taught data science to professionals in an industrial setting. In both of these situations, I used my research to inform my teaching and improve communication with students. 

I believe my experience as a data scientist and as research faculty in statistical forensics make me a good candidate for a tenure track position in the statistics department focused on social science. In particular, I have experience teaching and mentoring data science students, developing statistical software, and utilizing statistical and machine learning techniques in forensics, engineering, psychology, bioinformatics and agronomy. My research includes consideration of visual perception, memory, and numerical cognition; I use techniques from psychophysics and neuroscience when designing my research; in many ways, I already have a foot in the world of social science. I enjoy working at CSAFE and being a faculty member in the statistics department, and I am ready for the additional responsibility of teaching courses and working more closely with students. Please let me know if I can provide any additional information to assist you with your decision, and thank you for your consideration.  


% I have collaborated on research in a number of different fields, including psychology, engineering, and genetics, but the one common thread through all of these projects has been my focus on communicating the results of statistical analyses using visual and graphical tools. I am a senior researcher on an NIJ grant for 2019 to explore the best ways to use ROC curves to communicate the strength of forensic evidence to examiners, lawyers, and jurors. I am also laying the groundwork for a human factors project that will be part of the CSAFE renewal proposal, examining how jurors evaluate statistical evidence. My Ph.D. research focused on the perception of statistical graphics,
