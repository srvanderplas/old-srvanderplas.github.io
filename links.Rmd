## Awesome packages: 
- [shinyTable](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyTable): implements [Handsontable](http://handsontable.com/) for shiny, providing a spreadsheet-like editor in a web browser (data can then be read into R)

- [shinyRGL](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyRGL): provides webGL bindings, so that 3D graphics can be manipulated within shiny apps. Somewhat more difficult to set up the shiny-server backend, but still a very neat effect.
