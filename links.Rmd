# Useful Links


## Awesome packages: 
- [shinyTable](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyTable): implements [Handsontable](http://handsontable.com/) for shiny, providing a spreadsheet-like editor in a web browser (data can then be read into R)

- [shinyRGL](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyRGL): provides webGL bindings, so that 3D graphics can be manipulated within shiny apps. Somewhat more difficult to set up the shiny-server backend, but still a very neat effect. 



## Shiny library extensions: 
- [leaflet-shiny](https://github.com/jcheng5/leaflet-shiny): adds shiny bindings for [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), which makes mobile-friendly interactive maps

- [shiny-gridster](https://github.com/wch/shiny-gridster): use the [gridster](http://gridster.net/) library with shiny. Drag-and-drop multi-column grid layouts for web pages. 

- [shiny-jsdemo](https://github.com/wch/shiny-jsdemo): R shiny bindings for [gridster](http://gridster.net/), [justgage](http://justgage.com/), and [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/). Calls the shiny-gridster package as a dependency. Also includes a status panel. 

- [shiny-sky](https://github.com/AnalytixWare/ShinySky): Includes styled buttons and alerts not present in default shiny apps. Also adds event buttons and busy indicators, and includes [handsontable](http://handsontable.com/) and [jsTree](http://www.jstree.com/) bindings. Adds color input as well.
