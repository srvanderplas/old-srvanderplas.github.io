% About me
\begin{AboutMe}
I am a data engineer, that is, I transform data into informed decisions by building and interpreting mathematical models. 
I work with subject matter experts to understand and quantify prior knowledge, then incorporate data to create robust, accurate predictive models. 
These skills can be applied to variables such as day-ahead and real-time markets, network congestion, load balancing, megawatt valuation, and rate outlook, which I believe will greatly benefit NPPD.\vspace{-6pt}

\section*{LMP Data}
\subsection{Pinpointing Transmission Line Congestion}
On April 3, 2013, power prices spiked dramatically with no apparent explanation. SPP provides 5-minute resolution LMP data for power generation and interconnect stations. The power generation stations have known coordinates, which can be used to calculate (weighted) LMP by county, pinpointing (with some obvious error) the location of the congestion.

\subsection{Examining Power Prices during Summer Holidays}
I also explored LMP data to determine whether it would be most economical to schedule reduced power periods during summer holidays or during similar non-holiday periods (specifically, July 4). As I had only 5 years of data, I used Memorial Day and Labor Day as well as July 4th, as all three holidays generally involve time spent outdoors with family and friends. 

An initial plot of the summer power prices indicated that the holidays were not typically associated with significantly increased prices, as shown below.

\hfil\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=TRUE,width=.95\linewidth]{images/SummerPowerPrices2009-2013.png}\hfil

Examining the holiday weekends at closer range, and comparing them to non-holiday summer weekends, we can see that if anything, power prices are somewhat lower on Saturday and Sunday during holiday weekends than they are on non-holiday weekends (there are, of course, some spikes in LMP regardless of whether it is a holiday weekend).
