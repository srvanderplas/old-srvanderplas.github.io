% 1. I would like to be considered for the position of [title copied from job ad] in [exact department name from job ad] at the [exact institution name from job ad]. I am an advanced doctoral candidate in [your department].
% I would recommend, “I am writing in application to the position…”  

I am writing to apply for the Computational Modeling and Data Analytics faculty position at Virginia Tech University. I am a PhD candidate in the statistics departmant at Iowa State university, and am defending my dissertation in February 2015. I am applying for this position in part because the CMDA program elegantly provides the skill set for modern data analytics, balancing mathematical and statistical training with programming and applied courses, mirroring my own academic journey from mathematics (and cognitive psychology) to bioinformatics to statistics. 

% 2. My doctoral project is a study of [cocktail party description]. Much of the research on this topic suggests that [characterize the literature as woefully inadequate]. But I [demonstrate, reveal, discover] that contrary to received wisdom, [your punch line].

% 3. To complete this research I have spent [X years] doing [fieldwork/lab work/archival work/statistical analysis]. I have traveled to [these cities or libraries], interviewed [X number of experts], created [original datasets/original compositions/original artwork].
% “This sentence should be followed by a paragraph with the story of your research process. Overwhelm the committee with the volume of artifacts you’ve studied, people you’ve talked to, time you have dedicated or places you’ve been.”
%  Deliver this information crisply, factually, in no more than 2 sentences.

% 4. I have completed [X] of [Y] chapters of my dissertation, and I have included two substantive chapters as part of my writing sample.
% This is ok, although telling them what chapters you have finished in the dissertation is less important than telling them a concrete defense date in the first sentence, in my view.  Talk is cheap, but a defense date doesn’t lie.

% 5. I have well-developed drafts of several other chapters, and expect to defend in [month, year]. OR Having defended in [month, year], I plan to [turn it into a book-length manuscript for a major scholarly press/select key chapters for publication in disciplinary journals].
% “If any of your committee members are unwilling to commit to even a season of the year for your defense date, or you don’t have two substantive chapters to submit to the hiring committee, it’s too early for you to be on the academic job market.”

My doctoral research is a study of human perception of statistical graphics, with the ultimate goal of designing graphics to effectively communicate statistical results. The research on graphical perception is scattered across many different fields, including psychology, statistics, human-computer interaction, and communication, but is ultimately somewhat sparse, focusing either on extremely low-level effects, or very specific problems that are not applicable to most statistical graphics. Integrating an understanding of human perception and methodology from cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction, I have explored several facets of human perception that meaningfully impact the way we interact with statistical graphics: perceptual distortions that impact variance estimation along nonlinear trend lines (the ``sine illusion"), the influence of visual ability on graphical inference, and which features of a graph are most visually compelling. Two of these experiments have been presented at JSM, and one article has been accepted for publication in JCGS. Two other manuscripts are nearly ready for publication; I expect that the final chapter of my dissertation should be completed by mid-January 2015 and prepared for publication by March. 

\vspace{.25cm}
In addition to my own research on graphical perception, I collaborate with researchers in bioinformatics, genetics, and engineering, assisting with statistical analyses as well as data visualization. My masters' research was a result of a collaboration between bioinformatics and materials engineering; I designed a nonparametric algorithm to mimic human perception of peaks in spectroscopy data that had significantly higher resolution than manual peak identification. I am currently working with soybean geneticists at the USDA to explore, analyze, and visualize populations of soybean sequence data; the massive amounts of data are particularly challenging for visualization, as even utilizing interactivity and heavily summarized data, it is fairly easy to overload the visual system. 

\vspace{.25cm}
Looking forward, I intend to expand my research, exploring the perception of interactive graphics. Visualizations which respond to user attention dynamically and incorporate motion through animation or other transitions have the potential to more intuitively communicate experimental results, but the additional complexity may reduce the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed due to the increased demands on working memory and attention. As web-based interactive visualizations become more common, it is important that statisticians design graphics that are not only visually attractive, but also clearly communicate the overarching message in perceptually appropriate ways (preventing the rise of the animated, interactive three-dimensional pie chart and other equally horrifying graphs). 

% 6. Although my primary area of research is [disciplinary keyword here], I have additional expertise in [another disciplinary keyword here] and am eager to teach in both areas. I have [taught/served as a teaching assistant] in courses about [A, B and C]. In the next few years, I hope to develop courses in [X and Y].
% Of course you must describe teaching competencies, but don’t do it with vague claims and emotion-talk.  Eager?  Hope?  How does that help us?  Again, 250 other people will resting their cases on exactly the same feelings. Give us facts and specifics instead.

\vspace{.5cm}
Although my primary area of research is in statistical graphics and data visualization, I have taught both computational and introductory statistics classes. For several years, I have co-taught workshops on R programming as a resource for the Iowa State community, introducing the language and presenting advanced topics including data visualization, formatting and arranging data for analysis, linear models; I also designed and helped to teach more targeted courses on the use of \texttt{knitr} for reproducible research and Rstudio's \texttt{Shiny} package for creating interactive web applets. In addition to the R workshops, I have also taught and assisted with a number of introductory statistical lab courses for engineering, bioinformatics, social science, and business undergraduate and graduate students. In both settings, I utilized frequent examples which allowed students to independently apply the course material in a guided setting, reinforcing students' understanding of the material and providing opportunities for self-assessment and feedback. 

% 7. For the most part, my approach to research is through [social science or humanistic method keyword here], and I would be interested in developing a methods class on this approach to research.
The interdisciplinary nature of the CMDA program is likely to attract a group of students who are technically skilled but often need to communicate technical results to non-technical audiences. I would be interested in developing or teaching a class which focuses on strategies for communication of technical results in a non-technical setting, including the use of graphics and charts to effectively convey information. 

% 8. Although I have been focused on my graduate research for several years, I have been actively involved in conversations with [scholars in the department you are applying to, or scholars at other universities/professional associations/conferences/other disciplines].
% “This can be the one paragraph about service, highlighting conferences you’ve attended, workshops you’ve organized, and other ways you’ve supported your discipline.”
% The key here is conferences. Those are peer-reviewed and your attendance at them will set your record apart.  Never hang your hat on service.

% covered in the research and teaching sections

% 9. In the next few years, I hope to be able to investigate [reasonably related problems or questions].
% Everybody needs a second project.  However, please don’t articulate it in vague aspirational feeling language like “hope.”  Are you really that unsure?  That doesn’t inspire confidence.  And while we’re on the subject, don’t try, attempt, endeavor, or seek, either.  Read my post: Do. Or Do Not. There Is No Try.

% covered earlier

% 10. I am interested in this post for a variety of reasons: [something about the character of the department/university/community/city].
\vspace{.5cm}
My interdisciplinary training, research, and teaching experience fit well with the CMDA program's interdisciplinary focus on data analytics. I am also familiar with Blacksburg and Virginia Tech's culture: I was born a Hokie while my father was working on his dissertation in time series analysis (he graduated when I was about two). Please let me know if I can provide additional material, and feel free to look through my work on github; nearly all of my current research and other projects are publically available there. 

% 11. Because of my graduate training, my doctoral research, and my teaching [experience/interests], I am uniquely qualified for this job.
%  Connect your achievements and record with the position without recourse to wheedling claims.
