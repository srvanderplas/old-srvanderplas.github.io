\section{Theses}
\subsection{Dissertation}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{The Perception of Statistical Graphics}}
\cvitem{Committee}{Dr.~Heike Hofmann (Chair), Dr.~Dianne Cook, Dr.~Sarah Nusser, Dr.~Max Morris, Dr.~Erin McDonald, Dr.~Stephen Gilbert}
\cvitem{Abstract}{\small Research on statistical graphics and visualization generally focuses
on new types of graphics, new software to create graphics, interactivity, and usability
studies. Our ability to interpret and use statistical graphics hinges on the interface between
the graph itself and the brain that perceives and interprets it, and there is substantially less
research on the interplay between graph, eye, brain, and mind than is sufficient to understand
the nature of these relationships. This dissertation further explores the interplay between a static
graph, the translation of that graph from paper to mental representation (the journey from
eye to brain), and the mental processes that operate on that graph once it is transferred into
memory (mind). Understanding the perception of statistical graphics will allow researchers
to create more effective graphs which produce fewer distortions and viewer errors while reducing
the cognitive load necessary to understand the information presented in the graph.
