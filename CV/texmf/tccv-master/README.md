## Overview

**tccv** (two columns curriculum vitae) is a LaTeX class inspired by the
template found at
[latextemplates](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/two-column-one-page-cv)
by Alessandro Plasmati.

From a TeXnical point of view this is a complete rewrite. From the user
perspective, the most relevant differences from the original template are:

* this is a class, not a template document;
* more than one page are handled properly;
* the fonts are selected from the
  [psnfss](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/psnfss) collection, so no
  custom font installation should be required;
* it is plain LaTeX/Koma-script, so the CV can be compiled
  with the usual tools, latex and pdflatex included;
* the implementation is heavily based on custom environments
  and macros, so the document should be much easier to read
  (and customize);
* tccv is based on scrartcl (from Koma-script), not on article.

## How to use

You can download the [zipped
tarball](http://dev.entidi.com/p/tccv/source/download/master/) that includes a
couple of examples or pick only the relevant [LaTeX
class](http://dev.entidi.com/p/tccv/source/file/master/tccv.cls).

The code is maintained in a [git](http://git-scm.com/) repository [browsable
online](http://dev.entidi.com/p/tccv/source/tree/master/). A clone of that
repository can be found on [github](https://github.com/ntd/tccv): fill free to
fork it and extends in any way you like.

A sample PDF generated by the above class is [available
online](http://www.entidi.com/assets/pdf/nicola.en.pdf).
