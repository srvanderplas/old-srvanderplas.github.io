% About me
\begin{AboutMe}
I am a data scientist, that is, I transform data into informed decisions by building and interpreting mathematical models. 
I work with subject matter experts to understand and quantify prior knowledge, then incorporate data to create robust, accurate predictive models. 
I offer well-rounded statistical skills, programming expertise, and experience communicating statistical information to those outside the field.
