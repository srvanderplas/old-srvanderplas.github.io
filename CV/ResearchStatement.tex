% Para 1: A brief paragraph sketching the overarching thematics and topic of your research, situating it disciplinarily.
Statistical graphics are useful at every stage of the statistical process; during exploratory analysis, for examining model assumptions, and most importantly, for presenting statistical results. Graphics serve as a form of guided external cognition: by summarizing the data in an effective visual format, they free up cognitive resources, allowing the viewer to consider the implications of the data, rather than the data itself. It is important that graphics are carefully designed, displaying important features of the data in a way that facilitates visual inference. I am interested in this interface between statistical graphics and the brain, and I seek to understand how the brain processes statistical graphics and to apply that knowledge to create intuitive, effective, and interactive visual representations of complex, multidimensional, and large datasets. This research is highly interdisciplinary, integrating research from statistics, cognitive psychology, education, neuroscience, and human-computer interaction to communicate information more effectively. 

% Para 2: A summary of the dissertation research. This may replicate to some extent the paragraph on the dissertation in the cover letter, but it must have more detail about the methods, the theoretical foundations, and most of all, the core arguments.  Here, give a chapter summary, approximately one sentence per chapter.
\vspace{.65cm}\noindent {\large\textbf{Perception of Statistical Graphics}}\hspace{8pt}My dissertation examines the impact of several perceptual heuristics as they relate to statistical graphics. I begin by exploring the sine illusion (or line-width illusion), which commonly appears in data with nonlinear trends and affects the perception of the variance/mean relationship. In the first study, I propose two transformations which break the illusion, and evaluate those transformations with user studies, establishing both the presence of the illusion and the efficacy of the transformations. In a second study of the same illusion, I explore the psychological underpinnings of the illusion in order to establish that the illusion is persistent and occurs due to the wiring in the brain (with a supporting case study) and examine the size of the distortion and the variation in the general population with another user study. In the second chapter, I explore the interaction between tests of spatial ability and visual inference using statistical lineups (sets of 20 plots, 19 generated by permutation and one composed of real data); the experimental results suggest that lineups are ultimately a classification task and that accuracy of visual inference depends on demographic factors such as STEM training or research experience, completion of calculus 1, gender, and age, as well as underlying visual ability. In the final chapter, I explore the hierarchy of visual features in statistical graphics; that is, which graphical features are most visually salient (for example, do viewers notice outliers or cluster separation?) in the context of the lineup protocol. This work has implications for the design of new types of graphics, as graphics which highlight important features of the data intuitively free cognitive resources for higher-level tasks. 

% Para 3: A brief description of the contribution of the dissertation research to your field or fields, and a summary of publications associated with the dissertation research, including a plan for the book, if you are in a book field.
The sine illusion research highlights a seldom-discussed issue in statistical graphics: how do we ensure that information is perceived by the brain as it is presented graphically? The first study has been accepted to JCGS; the second study was selected for the Graphics section student paper award at JSM in 2014, and will be submitted to ACM Transactions on Applied Perception before the end of the year. The papers are intended to raise awareness of the illusion and its effect on a wide array of oft-used graphics, such as scatterplots, time-series charts, hammock plots, stream graphs, ribbon charts, and candlestick plots. The other studies are more focused on visual inference; that is, utilizing plots to conduct formal statistical inference and to explore the design of statistical charts. Understanding how demographic characteristics and visuospatial ability impact the perception of statistical graphics (and understanding which features of a graph are perceived most strongly) is important for statisticians, educators, and scientists, who may wish to tailor graphics to emphasize specific features of the data.

% [Addendum: Other ongoing research can be described here in more paragraphs in the event that you are going for a 2 page document]
\vspace{.65cm}\noindent {\large\textbf{Interactive Data Visualization}}\hspace{8pt}In addition to my research on the psychological underpinnings of statistical graphics, I also collaborate with researchers in other disciplines to create effective graphics for large datasets or multidimensional data. I have contributed to the development of the \texttt{animint} package for R, which extends the grammar of graphics (as implemented in \texttt{ggplot2}) to create interactive, animated graphics for the web. I have also worked with soybean researchers at the USDA to analyze and visualize soybean genetic data at the population and individual level; the result is a series of topic-specific interactive applets (using \texttt{animint} and RStudio's \texttt{Shiny} package) which integrate the data and analysis for use by biologists. Working with co-authors, I have also created interactive applets for use in the statistics classroom; these applets were designed to intuitively demonstrate difficult statistical concepts. 


% Para 4: A summary of the next research project, providing a topic, methods, a theoretical orientation, and brief statement of contribution to your field or fields. Mention publications, conference talks, or grants related to the new project.
\vspace{.65cm}\noindent {\large\textbf{Future Research}}\hspace{8pt}Integrate P2/3 and P4 - research on interactive graphics using eye tracking and user studies to determine what types of inferences are most natural and reliable for linked plots, point-and-click interactivity, and animation type interactive plots. 

% Para 5: A brief summary of the wider impact of your research agenda(s) writ large—what do they “tell us” that is valuable and important, both for a discipline but also for a wider scholarly community, and in some cases, for humanity in general.
