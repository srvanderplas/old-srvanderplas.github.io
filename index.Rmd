I've migrated this site to [https://srvanderplas.netlify.com/](https://srvanderplas.netlify.com/) so that I can take full advantage of [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and it's features. You will be redirected automatically in 5 seconds. 

The remaining items in this repository are here to ensure that old links keep working.
