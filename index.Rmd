# CV
[Here](CV/CV-SusanVanderPlas.pdf) is a link to my current CV/resume. I expect to graduate in Spring 2015 with my PhD in Statistics and am looking for a job that is flexible with regards to geographic location.


# Presentations
* [The Curse of Three Dimensions: Why Your Brain is Lying To You](Presentations/WhyYourBrainIsLyingToYou/JSM2014.html) - given at JSM 2014. This work won the Graphics section Student Paper Award. More information (and the current paper draft) is available [here](www.github.com/srvanderplas/LieFactorSine/AcmTransactions).

* [Animint presentation](Presentations/Animint/animint.html) - given at the Great Plains R User group in May 2014. Animint is an R package I started working on due to Google Summer of Code.

# Other Links
I add to these when I get a chance; most recently, I was exploring shiny extensions. 

## Awesome packages: 
- [shinyTable](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyTable): implements [Handsontable](http://handsontable.com/) for shiny, providing a spreadsheet-like editor in a web browser (data can then be read into R)

- [shinyRGL](https://github.com/trestletech/shinyRGL): provides webGL bindings, so that 3D graphics can be manipulated within shiny apps. Somewhat more difficult to set up the shiny-server backend, but still a very neat effect. 



### Shiny library extensions: 
- [leaflet-shiny](https://github.com/jcheng5/leaflet-shiny): adds shiny bindings for [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), which makes mobile-friendly interactive maps

- [shiny-gridster](https://github.com/wch/shiny-gridster): use the [gridster](http://gridster.net/) library with shiny. Drag-and-drop multi-column grid layouts for web pages. 

- [shiny-jsdemo](https://github.com/wch/shiny-jsdemo): R shiny bindings for [gridster](http://gridster.net/), [justgage](http://justgage.com/), and [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/). Calls the shiny-gridster package as a dependency. Also includes a status panel. 

- [shiny-sky](https://github.com/AnalytixWare/ShinySky): Includes styled buttons and alerts not present in default shiny apps. Also adds event buttons and busy indicators, and includes [handsontable](http://handsontable.com/) and [jsTree](http://www.jstree.com/) bindings. Adds color input as well.
